<em>
  The Smart Contract Enabled Online Examination System Based on Blockchain is a project that 
aims to revolutionize the traditional examination system by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. 
The project proposes a tamper-proof and transparent examination system that is based on smart contract 
technology. The system will provide students with the opportunity to take exams from anywhere in the 
world, without the need for a physical examination center. The proposed system will also eliminate the 
need for third-party examination invigilators, thereby reducing costs and ensuring integrity. The system's 
architecture will consist of four components: the blockchain, smart contracts, a user interface, and an 
authentication mechanism.
